i'm trying to split the packages into separate crates, because the compile times
are starting to become unbearable. also this will give the project some
much-needed structure, because as of late it's starting to feel messy. lots of
files in the same directory.

list of subcrates:

- lib: lang (just the AST)
- lib: builtins (includes ChatReply command for now)
- lib: interpreter (includes env::Interpreter, ExecutionEnvironment and AsyncExecutor)
- lib: genies (EnvGenie and CodeGenie), because i can't figure out where else to put them
- bin: editor (includes UiToolkit, renderer, and main binary for launching editor)
- bin: chatbot (includes chatbot and functions needed for chat)
