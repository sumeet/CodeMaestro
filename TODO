- menu doesn't always disappear in wasm

- panic inducing menu items that we don't need to show in wasm - Save and Exit

- split the project into separate crates so it can compile faster

- better looking autocomplete menu, is able to show wrap operation correctly

- clicking node selects it

- argument access looks like a single button instead of two buttons

- hovering changes color of buttons in html

- implement function call rendering in code, there's enough groundwork to
implement it now

- many functions need their argument names hidden, esp when there's only one argument. for instance Print, or Reply, or Capitalize.

- some functions need their argument names visible, even if there's only one argument. for example, `Reverse geocode` which takes a location
