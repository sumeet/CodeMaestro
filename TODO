- continue working on the design of wasm, make it look just as good as the native
  version



that list is old, idk if it's still relevant, i don't want to look at it rn:

------

p1:

- opening chat program editor from the quick start menu in wasm... it doesn't pop over. generally new windows should pop over existing ones, wasm's got it right. i think all that needs to be done really is to try giving focus to newly opened windows, ugh idk how hard that will be. another fix could just be drawing it in a different place, away from where the first window will pop open... idk

  - figured out a solution for this. manage the quick start window just like any other window is managed:
    - hardcode the ID and initial size inside window_position.rs, if creating a new WindowPositions then include the quick start window
    - make it thinner
    - have to add to window positions code to open the next window to the RIGHT of current ones, and if there's no more space to the right, then open it UNDER

- fix alignment of button and text in quick start guide will this fix need to be applied elsewhere? check the imgui rendering, especially of the menu, and see if that lines up as well as the wasm version

do later:

- hovering changes color of buttons in html

- implement function call rendering in code, there's enough groundwork to implement it now

- many functions need their argument names hidden, esp when there's only one argument. for instance Print, or Reply, or Capitalize.

- some functions need their argument names visible, even if there's only one argument. for example, `Reverse geocode` which takes a location

- change string to text
