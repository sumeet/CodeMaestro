- hovering changes color of buttons in html

- implement function call rendering in code, there's enough groundwork to
implement it now

- many functions need their argument names hidden, esp when there's only one argument. for instance Print, or Reply, or Capitalize.

- some functions need their argument names visible, even if there's only one argument. for example, `Reverse geocode` which takes a location

- wrap operation fixing:
  x local variables are constant... they can't wrap anything
  x regular function menu shouldn't show anything, we have a special wrapped function generator
  x control flow: only wrap if boolean
  x control flow: only wrap if result
  x struct literal: only wrap if one of the field types matches
  x other literals cannot wrap anything
